(* The relationship between classical logic and the one-hole structure:
  
  This file demonstrates that AlphaSet, with its single impossible predicate
  and classical logic for propositions, provides a natural foundation for
  classical reasoning about predicates. Every predicate either falls into
  the unique "hole" (the_impossible) or has witnesses - there is no middle ground.
  
  The spatial nature of AlphaSet shows how classical logic organizes predicates
  not through temporal evolution (as in some paraconsistent systems) but through
  spatial relationships: predicates either coincide with the impossible, 
  have disjoint witnesses, or overlap in their truth regions.
