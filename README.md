# Generativity and Information Flow
This repository hosts mathematical theory, applications, and articles investigating the idea that many facets of reality are structured by their constraints.

## Repo Overview
Files you might be interested in:
- `DAO/`: DAO theory library implemented in Rocq Theorem Prover (aka Coq) and Lean. DAO is a fully constructive math foundation that studies the nature of diagonal arguments, impossibility, and paradoxes.
- `AI/`: Metaprompts teaching LLMs to use the conceptual framework.
- `physics/Plots.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with plots of the maximum information flow principle. See `./DAO/Rocq/src/Computation/InformationFlow.v` for proofs of why this should happen in any discrete, countably finite system.
