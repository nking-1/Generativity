# Generativity and Information Flow
This repository hosts experimental notebooks and systems built on the theory of generativity and information flow discussed in the working paper "Reality Computes Itself."

## Repo Overview
Files you might be interested in:
- `PhysicsNumericTesting.ipynb`: Contains numeric simulations of the maximum information flow formula for physical systems at various scales.
- `optimization_prompt.md`: A metaprompt that teaches the generativity framework to a language model to enhance its reasoning abilities.
- `recursive_reasoning.ipynb`: Demonstrates LLM recursive reasoning using the information flow principle, balancing complexity and adaptation.
- `proofs_with_claude.md`: Demonstrates a metaprompt for Claude that has shown success in solving IMO problems.

## Future Directions
### Physics
- Validate the maximum information flow formula with empirical data.
- Expand physics numeric tests to include extreme environments.
- Implement the physical turing machine framework and explore its implications.
- Investigate the relationship between information flow and problems like the dome paradox.
- Coq proofs of information flow derivations.

### Math
- Rigorous Coq proofs of the information flow formula, as well as some new pillars of the framework that will be published soon.
