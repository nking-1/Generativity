# DAO Theory: Differentiation Alpha Omega

The mathematical framework showing reality as the stable solution 
to the Everything/Nothing paradox through omega_veil.

## Core Results

- **OmegaType**: Complete but trivial (contains all contradictions)
- **AlphaType**: Consistent but incomplete (exactly one impossible predicate)  
- **omega_veil**: The unique impossible predicate that maintains the gradient
- **Necessity of Existence**: Reality exists because Nothing = Everything = trivial

This explains:
- Why mathematics has the structure it does
- Why consciousness and free will are possible  
- Why optimization hits fundamental limits
- Why the universe has information processing constraints

The framework shows that veils (omega_veil, event horizons, quantum uncertainty, 
divine hiddenness) are not bugs but the fundamental features that make 
structured existence possible.
