# 🧪 Entropy Lab - Computational Physics Puzzle Game

**A React game that teaches total functional programming through interactive puzzles**

## 🎮 **What Is This Game?**

Entropy Lab is a **physics-based puzzle game** where players manipulate computational universes using **Unravel's total functional programming principles**. Instead of traditional game mechanics, players work with:

- **Mathematical operations** that never crash (division by zero = structured void)
- **Entropy management** as a core game mechanic
- **Conservation laws** that must be respected to win
- **Thermodynamic universes** that evolve with each computation

## 🌟 **Game Mechanics Based on Mathematics**

### **Core Gameplay:**
- **Numbers** as building blocks
- **Operations** (÷, +, recover) that follow mathematical laws
- **Entropy** as a resource to manage (like health/mana in RPGs)
- **Void encounters** as puzzle elements (not failure states!)

### **Mathematical Education:**
- **Noether's Theorem**: Equivalent operations have identical entropy
- **Conservation Laws**: Recovery preserves entropy exactly
- **BaseVeil Principle**: All impossibilities have entropy ≥ 1
- **Thermodynamic Evolution**: Universe state changes with each operation

## 🎯 **Level Progression**

### **Level 1: First Contact**
- **Goal**: Get 42 using safe division
- **Teaches**: Division by zero becomes structured void
- **Key insight**: Errors don't crash - they provide information

### **Level 2: Entropy Management**  
- **Goal**: Reach 100 while keeping entropy below 3
- **Teaches**: Entropy as a limited resource
- **Key insight**: Smart operation planning to minimize impossibility

### **Level 3: Conservation Laws**
- **Goal**: Demonstrate Noether's theorem

- **Teaches**: Non-linear entropy accumulation
- **Key insight**: Complex failure patterns have mathematical structure

### **Level 5: Heat Death Challenge**
- **Goal**: Push universe to heat death, then recover
- **Teaches**: System limits and recovery strategies
- **Key insight**: Even extreme entropy states can be managed
