(** * DAO Theory - The Duality of Alpha and Omega
    
    A mathematical framework that formalizes veils as fundamental features of reality.
    The name captures both the mathematical duality and the deep connection to 
    Daoist philosophy - the ineffable Dao that cannot be named.
    
    This is the main entry point for the DAO library.

(** ** Quick Overview
    
    DAO Theory provides:
    - OmegaType: Complete but paradoxical (Yang - Everything)
    - AlphaType: Consistent but incomplete (Yin - Structure)  
    - NomegaType: The empty type (Wu - Void)
    - GenerativeType: Time-indexed type for temporal paradox resolution
    
    The omega_veil boundary maintains the gradient between complete/trivial 
    and consistent/incomplete, enabling mathematics and meaning to exist.
