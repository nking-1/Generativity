// EXPERIMENT: Radioactive Decay (Time Evolution)
// We test if the 'rate' observable responds to the flow of time.

// 1. The "Flash": Create entropy immediately
let _ = shield(1/0) recover 0 in

// 2. Measure Initial Rate (High)
let r_init = rate in

// 3. The "Long Wait": Evolve time forward without doing work
// This simulates system idle time or bit-rot latency.
let _ = evolve(1000) in

// 4. Measure Final Rate (Should be lower)
let r_final = rate in
