// THE IMPOSSIBLE PROOF
// A program that tries to prove its own consistency

// Define: "I am consistent" = "I have zero entropy"
let consistency_claim = (entropy == 0) in

// But checking consistency creates entropy!
// This is the diagonal:

let proof_attempt = 
    // Assume we're consistent
    if consistency_claim
    then
        // Try to prove it by checking all paths
        let path1 = shield (1 / 0) recover 0 in
        let path2 = shield (0 / 0) recover 0 in
        let path3 = shield (1 / (entropy - entropy)) recover 0 in
        
        // Did we stay consistent?
        if entropy == 0
        then 1  // "Proof succeeded!"
        else 0  // "We created entropy while proving consistency"
    else
        0 - 1  // "We were never consistent" (using 0-1 instead of -1)
in

// The Gödel sentence: "This statement is unprovable"
// In our framework: "Checking this creates entropy"
let goedel_sentence = 
    let before = entropy in
    let _ = entropy in  // Act of observation
    let after = entropy in
    
    // If observation changed entropy, the sentence is "true but unprovable"
    if after > before
    then [1, after - before]  // [true, cost_of_proving]
    else [0, 0]  // [false or trivial, no cost]
