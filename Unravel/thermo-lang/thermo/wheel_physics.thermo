// TEST: Wheel Theory Physics
// We create Infinity. We use it. We resolve it.

// 1. Create Infinity (Valid VInf, Entropy = 0)
let infinity = 1 / 0 in

// 2. Do math with it (1000 + Inf = Inf)
let big_inf = infinity + 1000 in

// 3. Invert it (10 / Inf = 0). 
// This is the "Wheel" property. It resolves back to a valid integer!
let zero = 10 / big_inf in

// 4. Trigger a Singularity using the derived zero
// This is the only step that should generate entropy.
